Ritchey Permissive License is a permissive license first released in 2015. It is primarily used by the author, James Ritchey, for his open source projects, though anyone can use it. Versions of the license text can be quite different, so when discussing specific aspects of the license, itâ€™s important to clarify which version is being discussed.

The license was originally named Comprehensible Open License, because it focused on using plain language, and keeping the overall length to a minimum. Basically, it wanted to be easily comprehensible. Over time, the focus has changed, and many legal features have been added.

As of version 16, the license aims to provide near-Public Domain permissions, using reasonable language, while providing the licensor with more protection than a dedication to the Public Domain typically does.
