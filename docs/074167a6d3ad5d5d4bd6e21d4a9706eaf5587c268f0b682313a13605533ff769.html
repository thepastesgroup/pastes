Ritchey Permissive License v16

An open source license used/authored by James Ritchey. It prioritizes both user freedom, and publisher protection. It’s somewhat comparable to the MIT license, but defines more of it’s terms.

It is typically applied to software, but the language of the license is intentionally non-specific in regards to this, so that the license can be used for other types of creative works as well (e.g. Documentation).
