Ritchey Permissive License v16 (RPLv16) is a permissive license aimed at open source projects. It is moderate in length, and uses some legal terminology. The license grants broad permissions, while seeking publisher protections in return. Unlike nearly all permissive, open source, and copyleft licenses, it imposes jurisdictional requirements on arbitration. This is one of several unique features the license employs.
