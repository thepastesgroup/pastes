Ritchey Permissive License

RPL (Ritchey Permissive License) is a near-Public Domain license typically applied to open source projects. While obscure, it has been around for many years, and gained some attention for it’s rejection by the OSI.

The key features, of the current version of the license, are:

 - It is very permissive. There isn’t even a requirement for attribution!
 - It provides protections not found in comparable licenses.
 - It includes statements that withdraw its availability in certain jurisdictions.
 - It defines important terms.
 - It binds to Canadian law.
