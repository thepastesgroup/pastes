Ritchey Permissive License v16 is an open license developed by (IANAL) James Daniel Marrs Ritchey. It imposes few requirements on the user, making it a highly permissive license. It was released in 2023, but hasnâ€™t yet received much adoption, beyond use by the author. While not OSI approved, it does meet alternative open source license definitions, including that of Wikipedia, and The Opensource Group.
