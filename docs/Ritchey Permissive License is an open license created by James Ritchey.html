Ritchey Permissive License is an open license created by James Ritchey. Despite being around for nearly a decade, the project has seen limited adoption, within the open source community. It is primarily used by the author, for software, and writing projects. The license is compatible with many popular open source licenses, because it imposes few obligations on users.
